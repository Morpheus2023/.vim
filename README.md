# .vim
This is my .vim folder . With creating this repo I've backed up all of my plugins. This repo does not contain my .virmc 
because I've already uploaded it on the "dotfiles" repo and its visibility is private.

To install my vim evironment on your machine write the following commands on the terminal-
git clone git@github.com:Morpheus2023/.vim.git ~/.vim (if using ssh).
